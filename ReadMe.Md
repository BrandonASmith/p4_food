#Crumblr


This is app is a platform for users to post recipes they've made or found and share them with fellow users in a Tumblr feed. 

I would eventually like to add a clickable map, that sorts recipes by cuisine. Upon clicking a country, the app with recomend a random recipes from that cuisine ID.
